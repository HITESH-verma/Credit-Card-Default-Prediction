# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

1. Project Overview
	•	Define the problem statement: Predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment next month.
	•	Outline the business importance and expected outcomes.

2. Dataset Collection
	•	Source: Mention dataset origin (e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle).
	•	Describe key features (e.g., LIMIT_BAL, AGE, PAY_X, BILL_AMT_X, PAY_AMT_X).
	•	Mention target variable: default.payment.next.month.

3. Data Preprocessing
	•	Handle missing values (if any).
	•	Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, education, marriage status).
	•	Normalize/standardize numerical features.
	•	Split into training and test sets.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Visualize feature distributions.
	•	Analyze correlations between features and target variable.
	•	Identify outliers and handle them if necessary.
	•	Check for class imbalance.

5. Feature Engineering
	•	Create new features if needed.
	•	Apply feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation filtering, mutual information).
	•	Reduce dimensionality (PCA) if applicable.

6. Model Selection & Training
	•	Test multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM).
	•	Use cross-validation for robust performance estimation.
	•	Handle class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

7. Model Evaluation
	•	Evaluate using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
	•	Plot confusion matrix and ROC curve.
	•	Compare model performance and select the best one.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning
	•	Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.
	•	Re-evaluate tuned model.

9. Model Deployment
	•	Save trained model using joblib or pickle.
	•	Build a simple interface (e.g., Flask, Streamlit) for predictions.
	•	Provide usage instructions in README.

10. Conclusion & Future Work
	•	Summarize results and key insights.
	•	Suggest improvements for future versions.
